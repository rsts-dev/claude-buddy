# Tasks: [FEATURE NAME]

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, jdl-model.jdl, api-contracts/, frontend-design.md, test-scenarios.md

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: JHipster version, application type, frontend framework, database, authentication
2. Load optional design documents:
   → jdl-model.jdl: Extract entities → entity generation tasks
   → api-contracts/: Extract endpoints → REST controller customization tasks
   → frontend-design.md: Extract custom UI components → frontend tasks
   → test-scenarios.md: Extract test cases → test implementation tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: JHipster project initialization, JDL import
   → Tests (Backend): Repository tests, service tests, REST controller tests
   → Tests (Frontend): Component tests, e2e tests
   → Core (Backend): Entity generation, service layer, custom business logic, REST endpoints
   → Core (Frontend): Entity CRUD UI, custom components, routing, state management
   → Integration: Security, database migrations, external integrations
   → Polish: Performance optimization, accessibility, documentation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different entities/components = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
   → Backend before frontend (API contracts first)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All entities have tests?
   → All custom logic has tests?
   → All UI components have tests?
   → All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Dependencies

**Critical Path**:
- Setup (T001-T006) → Backend Tests (T007-T020) → Backend Implementation (T021-T036) → Frontend Tests (T037-T047) → Frontend Implementation (T048-T062)
- Tests MUST fail before implementation begins
- Backend complete before frontend implementation (API contracts established)
- Integration (T063-T079) after core implementation
- Polish (T080-T100) after all implementation complete

**Blocking Dependencies**:
- T002 (JDL import) blocks T003 (entity generation)
- T003 (entity generation) blocks T004-T006 (review generated code)
- T004-T006 (review) block T007-T020 (backend tests)
- T007-T020 (backend tests) block T021-T036 (backend implementation)
- T021-T036 (backend implementation) block T037-T047 (frontend tests - API contracts needed)
- T037-T047 (frontend tests) block T048-T062 (frontend implementation)
- T063-T079 (integration) require T036 (backend complete) and T062 (frontend complete)
- T080-T100 (polish) require all prior phases complete

**Parallel Opportunities**:
- Different entities can be tested/implemented in parallel
- Backend and frontend tests for same entity can run in parallel after backend implementation
- Documentation tasks can run in parallel
- Static analysis and code coverage can run in parallel

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Example 1: Repository Tests (T007-T010)
```bash
# Launch T007-T010 together (different entities):
Task: "Repository test for Customer in src/test/java/com/example/repository/CustomerRepositoryTest.java"
Task: "Repository test for Order in src/test/java/com/example/repository/OrderRepositoryTest.java"
Task: "Test Customer-Order relationship in CustomerRepositoryTest"
```

### Example 2: REST Controller Tests (T015-T016)
```bash
# Launch T015-T016 together (different entities):
Task: "REST integration test for CustomerResource in src/test/java/com/example/web/rest/CustomerResourceIT.java"
Task: "REST integration test for OrderResource in src/test/java/com/example/web/rest/OrderResourceIT.java"
```

### Example 3: Frontend Component Tests (T037-T040)
```bash
# Launch T037-T040 together (different entities):
Task: "Component test for Customer list in src/test/javascript/spec/app/entities/customer/customer.component.spec.ts"
Task: "Component test for Customer detail in src/test/javascript/spec/app/entities/customer/customer-detail.component.spec.ts"
Task: "Component test for Order list in src/test/javascript/spec/app/entities/order/order.component.spec.ts"
```

## Notes
- **[P] tasks** = different files/entities, no dependencies
- **Verify tests fail** before implementing (TDD validation)
- **Commit after each task** with meaningful messages
- **Run tests after each implementation** to ensure they pass
- **Use JHipster generators** whenever possible (don't manually create entities)
- **Follow JHipster conventions** (naming, structure, patterns)
- **Externalize configuration** (use application.yml for all config values)
- **Use DTOs for REST APIs** (avoid exposing entities directly)
- **Avoid**: Vague tasks, same file conflicts, missing error handling

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From JDL Model**:
   - Each entity → repository test task [P]
   - Each entity → service test task [P]
   - Each entity → REST controller test task [P]
   - Each entity → backend implementation tasks
   - Each entity → frontend component test tasks [P]
   - Each entity → frontend implementation tasks

2. **From API Contracts**:
   - Each custom endpoint → REST controller test
   - Each custom endpoint → implementation task

3. **From Frontend Design**:
   - Each custom component → component test [P]
   - Each custom component → implementation task [P]
   - Each custom page → e2e test

4. **From Test Scenarios**:
   - Each user story → e2e test
   - Each edge case → unit/integration test

5. **Ordering**:
   - Setup → Backend Tests → Backend Implementation → Frontend Tests → Frontend Implementation → Integration → Polish
   - Dependencies block parallel execution
   - Always tests before corresponding implementation
