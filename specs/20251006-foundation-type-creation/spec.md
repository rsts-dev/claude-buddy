## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a Claude Buddy user working on a Spring Boot project, I want to create a "spring-boot" foundation type within my project so that all spec/plan/task/docs generation uses Spring Boot-specific templates and context, enabling Claude to provide more relevant and framework-aware assistance throughout my development workflow.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user wants to create a new foundation type for Spring Boot, **When** they execute the foundation type creation command with "spring-boot" as the parameter, **Then** the system generates complete template scaffolding in the templates directory and creates the context directory structure for Spring Boot-specific knowledge

2. **Given** a user provides documentation URLs for their framework, **When** they include these URLs during foundation type creation, **Then** the system retrieves and processes the documentation content into context files that enhance AI understanding of the framework

3. **Given** a foundation type "django" already exists, **When** a user attempts to create another foundation type named "django", **Then** the system prevents the creation and displays a clear error message about the naming conflict

4. **Given** a new foundation type has been created, **When** any agent (spec-writer, plan-writer, etc.) is invoked on a project using that foundation type, **Then** the agent automatically loads and uses the custom templates and context files specific to that foundation type

5. **Given** a user runs the foundation type command without parameters, **When** the interactive mode launches, **Then** the system guides them through a wizard that collects all necessary information step-by-step

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to create a foundation type with invalid characters (spaces, special characters)?
- How does system handle network failures when fetching documentation from URLs?
- What happens when template generation is interrupted mid-process?
- How does the system behave if context files are malformed markdown?
- What happens when a foundation type name conflicts with existing ones?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Foundation Type Creation
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide `/buddy:create-foundation-type` slash command for creating new foundation types
- **FR-002**: System MUST accept foundation type name as the primary parameter (e.g., `/buddy:create-foundation-type spring-boot`)

#### Foundation Type Discovery
- **FR-022**: System MUST discover available foundation types by scanning `.claude-buddy/templates/` directory

### Key Entities

- **Foundation Type**: Represents a specific technology stack or framework (e.g., spring-boot, django, fastapi) with associated templates and context knowledge. Contains metadata such as name, description, version, and creation date.

- **Template Set**: Collection of document templates (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, docs.md) customized for a specific foundation type. Each template contains framework-specific sections and guidance.

- **Context Knowledge**: Framework-specific best practices, patterns, and conventions stored as markdown files. Used by agents to enhance understanding and generate more relevant outputs.

- **Foundation Registry**: Central catalog of all available foundation types with their metadata, usage tracking, and version information.

- **Foundation Type Configuration**: Settings and preferences for a foundation type including optional sections, section ordering, validation rules, and quality checklists.

## Clarifications Received

All clarification questions have been answered:

1. **Security validation scope**: Not applicable - users manage their own context content
2. **Context file size limits**: No limits enforced - users manage context file sizes
3. **Deletion permanence**: Not applicable - users can manually delete directories if needed
4. **Versioning strategy**: Not applicable - simple directory-based foundation types without versioning
5. **Migration compatibility**: Not applicable - no automated migration system needed
6. **Context source validation**: Not applicable - users can provide any URLs they choose
7. **Template customization depth**: **Complete freedom** - users can fully customize templates for their needs
8. **Multi-language support**: Not applicable - English is standard, users can customize as needed
9. **Dependency management**: Not applicable - each foundation type is independent
10. **Conflict resolution**: **Prompt user with list of best guesses** - system suggests foundation types and lets user choose

---

## Assumptions Made

The following assumptions have been made based on the current system context:

1. Foundation types follow the existing directory structure at `.claude-buddy/templates/{foundation-type}/` and `.claude-buddy/context/{foundation-type}/`
2. The "default" foundation type serves as the baseline for creating new foundation types
3. Context files are markdown format (`.md`) for consistency with existing patterns
4. Foundation type names use lowercase, hyphenated naming (e.g., `spring-boot`, `django-rest`)
5. Each project uses one foundation type at a time, specified in `directive/foundation.md` metadata
6. Foundation types are project-local (not shared across different projects)

---

## Success Metrics

The feature will be considered successful when:

1. Users can create a new foundation type with `/buddy:create-foundation-type {name}` command
2. All four generated templates (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, docs.md) are immediately usable by existing agents
3. Context files loaded from provided URLs enhance agent understanding of the framework
4. Existing foundation types (default, jhipster, mulesoft) continue working without modification
5. Foundation type creation completes successfully with clear confirmation of created files
6. System handles naming conflicts and invalid inputs with clear error messages
7. When multiple foundation types exist, users are prompted with suggested options
