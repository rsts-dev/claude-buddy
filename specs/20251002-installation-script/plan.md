**Created**: 2025-10-02
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/20251002-installation-script/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/buddy:plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → Specification loaded successfully
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Project Type: Single project (Node.js CLI tool)
   → Structure Decision: Single project with CLI entry point
3. Fill the Foundation Check section based on the content of the foundation document.
4. Evaluate Foundation Check section below
   → Initial compliance verification in progress
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Foundation Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → Research topics identified: Transactional installation patterns, NPM postinstall behavior, Cross-platform compatibility
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md
7. Re-evaluate Foundation Check section

- Phase 2: /buddy:tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary

The installation script feature automates the setup and configuration of Claude Buddy in developer projects. It provides a robust, cross-platform installation process that handles fresh installations, updates, uninstallations, and graceful degradation when optional dependencies are missing. The script implements transactional installation with rollback capabilities, preserves user customizations during updates, and provides comprehensive verification and user feedback. This feature is critical for the project's NPM distribution strategy and ensures a smooth adoption experience for users.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: JavaScript (Node.js 18+)
**Primary Dependencies**: Node.js filesystem API (fs/promises), path module, child_process for UV/Python detection, chalk for terminal styling
**Storage**: File system operations for configuration, hooks, templates, and personas
**Testing**: Manual testing for fresh install, update, uninstall, dry-run scenarios; automated tests using Taskfile.yml
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform (macOS, Linux, Windows) via Node.js
**Project Type**: Single project (CLI tool distributed via NPM)
**Performance Goals**: Installation completes in under 30 seconds for fresh install, under 10 seconds for updates
**Constraints**: Must work in non-interactive mode for CI/CD pipelines, must not require root/admin privileges
**Scale/Scope**: Installs approximately 50 files across 3 main directories (.claude-buddy/, .claude/, directive/)

## Foundation Check (Initial - Pre-Research)
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research.*

Based on `/directive/foundation.md` v1.0.0, verify compliance with:

### Principle 1: Modular Extensibility
- [x] Feature components are designed as independent modules
  - Installation logic separated into modules: environment detection, file operations, validation, rollback
  - Each installation component (hooks, templates, personas, configs) treated as independent unit
- [x] New functionality extends without modifying core framework
  - Installation script is a standalone tool that sets up the framework without modifying its internals
  - Framework files are copied as-is without transformation
- [x] Templates and configurations are properly isolated
  - Installation manifest defines clear boundaries between system files and user customizations
  - Configuration detection logic isolates user modifications from framework defaults

### Principle 2: Safety-First Automation
- [x] All automated operations include validation steps
  - Pre-installation environment checks (permissions, dependencies, conflicts)
  - Post-installation verification of all installed components
  - Dry-run mode for previewing changes before execution
- [x] Destructive operations are explicitly protected
  - Uninstall requires explicit command flag
  - User customizations are preserved by default during updates
  - Transactional installation with automatic rollback on failure
- [x] Error handling prevents unintended consequences
  - All file operations wrapped in try-catch with detailed error reporting
  - Graceful degradation for missing optional dependencies
  - Rollback mechanism ensures no partial/broken installations

### Principle 3: Contextual Intelligence
- [x] Design leverages foundation document principles
  - Installation script references foundation principles in verification step
  - Template selection based on foundation type from directive/foundation.md
- [x] Context from previous phases propagates forward
  - Version tracking enables intelligent update vs fresh install detection
  - Configuration migration logic maintains context across versions
- [x] Templates maintain consistency with project patterns
  - Installation creates foundation document if missing (via prompt)
  - All installed templates reference foundation principles

### Principle 4: Developer Experience Excellence
- [x] Clear documentation for all new components
  - Comprehensive help text for all CLI flags (--help, --dry-run, --verbose, --uninstall)
  - Post-installation output displays usage examples and next steps
  - Verbose mode provides detailed logging for troubleshooting
- [x] Error messages provide actionable guidance
  - Permission errors suggest required actions
  - Missing dependency warnings include installation instructions
  - Conflict detection prompts user with resolution options
- [x] Progressive disclosure of advanced features
  - Basic usage requires zero flags (intelligent defaults)
  - Advanced options available via flags for power users
  - Non-interactive mode for CI/CD integration

### Principle 5: Transparent Collaboration
- [x] Changes maintain clear attribution trails
  - Installation log records all actions performed (file creates, updates, skips)
  - Version metadata tracks installation/update history
- [x] Automated operations are logged appropriately
  - Default: Summary logging with key actions
  - Verbose flag: Detailed logging of every operation
  - Dry-run: Preview of all planned actions
- [x] Human review points are explicitly defined
  - Conflict resolution requires user input (unless non-interactive)
  - Uninstallation confirms before deleting files
  - Update mode shows diff of what will change

**Violations Requiring Justification**: None - all foundation principles are satisfied by the design.

## Foundation Check (Post-Design - After Phase 1)

```

**Structure Decision**: Single project structure selected because this is a standalone CLI tool. The installation script is the entry point that sets up Claude Buddy framework files in the target project directory. All installation-related code is organized under the `setup/` directory to keep it isolated from the main Claude Buddy codebase. The `setup/lib/` directory contains modular components following Principle 1 (Modular Extensibility), and the framework files to be installed are already organized in their respective directories within `setup/`.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

### Research Topics Identified

Based on Technical Context unknowns and specification requirements, the following research areas must be explored:

1. **Transactional Installation Patterns**
   - How to implement atomic file operations with rollback capability in Node.js
   - Best practices for transaction logs and state tracking
   - Handling partial failures in multi-step installation processes
   - Recovery strategies for interrupted operations

2. **NPM Package Distribution & Installation Lifecycle**
   - NPM postinstall hooks vs bin scripts for installation entry points
   - How to package framework files for distribution via NPM
   - Cross-platform path handling (Windows vs Unix)
   - Working directory detection and validation

3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
   - File permission detection and handling across platforms
   - Path separator normalization (Windows backslash vs Unix forward slash)
   - Shell command execution differences (PowerShell vs Bash)
   - Terminal color support detection

4. **Dependency Detection & Graceful Degradation**
   - Methods for detecting UV installation (Python package manager)
   - Detecting Python version and availability
   - Checking for Node.js version compatibility
   - Fallback strategies when optional dependencies are unavailable

5. **Configuration Preservation & Migration**
   - Strategies for detecting user-modified vs framework files
   - Timestamp-based vs content-hash-based change detection
   - Configuration file merging strategies (shallow vs deep merge)
   - Schema migration patterns for version upgrades

6. **Version Management**
   - Where to store version metadata (.claude-buddy/version.json vs package.json reference)
   - Semantic version comparison for update logic
   - Handling version conflicts or downgrades

**Research Output**: A `research.md` file documenting:
- Decision: Selected approach for each research area
- Rationale: Why this approach was chosen over alternatives
- Alternatives considered: Other approaches evaluated
- Implementation notes: Key considerations for Phase 2 implementation

**Execution**: Research agents will be dispatched for each topic, findings consolidated into `research.md`.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

### 1. Data Model Design (`data-model.md`)

Extract entities from the specification and define their structure:

#### Installation Manifest
```javascript
{
  version: "1.0.0",
  components: [
    {
      name: "hooks",
      type: "required" | "optional",
      source: ".claude/hooks/",
      target: ".claude/hooks/",
      dependencies: ["uv", "python3"],
      files: ["*.py", "*.json"]
    },
    {
      name: "templates",
      type: "required",
      source: ".claude-buddy/templates/",
      target: ".claude-buddy/templates/",
      dependencies: [],
      files: ["**/*.md"]
    },
    // ... other components
  ],
  directories: [".claude-buddy", ".claude", "directive"],
  platformSpecific: {
    windows: { /* Windows-specific overrides */ },
    darwin: { /* macOS-specific overrides */ },
    linux: { /* Linux-specific overrides */ }
  }
}
```

#### Configuration State
```javascript
{
  installationStatus: "not_installed" | "installed" | "corrupted",
  installedVersion: "1.0.0",
  installDate: "2025-10-02T12:00:00Z",
  lastUpdateDate: "2025-10-02T14:00:00Z",
  enabledComponents: ["hooks", "templates", "personas", "configs"],
  userCustomizations: [
    {
      file: ".claude-buddy/personas/custom-persona.md",
      modifiedDate: "2025-10-02T13:00:00Z",
      preserveOnUpdate: true
    }
  ],
  dependencyStatus: {
    node: { available: true, version: "18.0.0" },
    python: { available: true, version: "3.11.0" },
    uv: { available: false, version: null }
  }
}
```

#### Installation Transaction
```javascript
{
  transactionId: "uuid-v4",
  startTime: "2025-10-02T12:00:00Z",
  endTime: null,
  status: "pending" | "in_progress" | "completed" | "failed" | "rolled_back",
  operation: "install" | "update" | "uninstall",
  preInstallSnapshot: {
    files: [/* file paths */],
    state: { /* configuration state */ }
  },
  plannedActions: [
    {
      type: "create" | "update" | "delete" | "skip",
      path: ".claude-buddy/buddy-config.json",
      reason: "Framework file",
      status: "pending" | "completed" | "failed"
    }
  ],
  executedActions: [/* completed actions */],
  errors: [
    {
      action: { /* action that failed */ },
      error: "Error message",
      timestamp: "2025-10-02T12:01:00Z"
    }
  ],
  rollbackPoint: { /* snapshot for restoration */ }
}
```

### 2. CLI Interface Design (Contracts)

Define the command-line interface contract:

```bash
# Fresh installation
claude-buddy install [target-directory]

# Update existing installation
claude-buddy update [target-directory]

# Uninstall
claude-buddy uninstall [target-directory] [--preserve-customizations]

# Dry-run mode
claude-buddy install --dry-run [target-directory]

# Verbose logging
claude-buddy install --verbose [target-directory]

# Non-interactive mode
claude-buddy install --non-interactive [target-directory]

# Help
claude-buddy --help
claude-buddy --version
```

**CLI Contract Specifications** (to be detailed in `contracts/cli-interface.md`):
- Exit codes: 0 (success), 1 (error), 2 (user cancellation)
- Output format: Human-readable text with optional JSON output (--json flag)
- Environment variables: CLAUDE_BUDDY_HOME, CLAUDE_BUDDY_VERBOSE
- Configuration file support: .claude-buddy-rc.json for defaults

### 3. API Contracts for Internal Modules

Each module in `lib/` will have a defined interface (to be detailed in `contracts/`):

- `lib/environment.js`: Environment detection API
- `lib/manifest.js`: Manifest loading and validation API
- `lib/installer.js`: Installation operations API
- `lib/updater.js`: Update operations API
- `lib/uninstaller.js`: Uninstallation operations API
- `lib/transaction.js`: Transaction management API
- `lib/logger.js`: Logging API

### 4. Test Scenarios from User Stories

Extract test scenarios from specification acceptance criteria:

**Integration Test: Fresh Installation**
```javascript
describe('Fresh Installation', () => {
  it('should create all necessary directories and files', async () => {
    // Given: Empty project directory
    // When: Run installation script
    // Then: All framework directories exist
    //       All framework files are present
    //       Version metadata is created
    //       Success message is displayed
  });
});
```

**Integration Test: Update Existing Installation**
```javascript
describe('Update Existing Installation', () => {
  it('should preserve user customizations while updating framework files', async () => {
    // Given: Project with Claude Buddy v1.0.0 installed
    //        User has customized persona file
    // When: Run installation script for v1.1.0
    // Then: Framework files are updated to v1.1.0
    //       User persona file is preserved
    //       Version metadata is updated
    //       Update summary is displayed
  });
});
```

**Integration Test: Dry-Run Mode**
```javascript
describe('Dry-Run Mode', () => {
  it('should show planned actions without modifying files', async () => {
    // Given: Any installation state
    // When: Run installation with --dry-run flag
    // Then: All planned actions are displayed
    //       No files are created or modified
    //       Warnings/issues are reported
  });
});
```

**Integration Test: Graceful Degradation**
```javascript
describe('Graceful Degradation', () => {
  it('should skip hooks when UV is not installed', async () => {
    // Given: Environment without UV installed
    // When: Run installation script
    // Then: Hook installation is skipped with warning
    //       Other components are installed successfully
    //       Warning message explains missing functionality
  });
});
```

**Integration Test: Uninstallation**
```javascript
describe('Uninstallation', () => {
  it('should remove all Claude Buddy files with optional preservation', async () => {
    // Given: Project with Claude Buddy installed
    // When: Run uninstallation command
    // Then: All framework files are removed
    //       User can choose to preserve customizations
    //       Confirmation message is displayed
  });
});
```

### 5. Quickstart Guide (`quickstart.md`)

The quickstart guide will provide:
- Installation command examples for different scenarios
- Verification steps to confirm successful installation
- Common troubleshooting tips
- Next steps after installation (running slash commands, creating specs)

### 6. Update CLAUDE.md (Agent Context)

**Update Strategy**:
- Add installation script technology (Node.js filesystem API, child_process)
- Preserve existing manual additions between markers
- Update recent changes section (keep last 3)
- Ensure file remains under 150 lines

**Output**: Updated CLAUDE.md in repository root with new context about installation script implementation.

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

*This section describes what the /buddy:tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /buddy:plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:

1. Load `.claude-buddy/templates/default/tasks.md` as base template
2. Generate tasks from Phase 1 design documents:
   - From `data-model.md`: Tasks for implementing data structures
   - From `contracts/`: Tasks for implementing CLI interface and module APIs
   - From test scenarios: Tasks for writing integration tests
   - From `quickstart.md`: Tasks for creating documentation

**Task Categories**:

1. **Setup & Infrastructure Tasks**
   - Create project structure (lib/ directory, test/ directory)
   - Update package.json with bin entry point
   - Set up test framework configuration

2. **Core Module Implementation Tasks** (following TDD order)
   - Implement `lib/logger.js` (needed by all other modules)
   - Implement `lib/environment.js` with detection logic
   - Implement `lib/manifest.js` with component definitions
   - Implement `lib/transaction.js` with rollback capability
   - Implement `lib/installer.js` with fresh install logic
   - Implement `lib/updater.js` with update logic
   - Implement `lib/uninstaller.js` with removal logic

3. **CLI Entry Point Tasks**
   - Implement `install.js` with argument parsing
   - Implement command routing (install/update/uninstall)
   - Implement help and version commands
   - Implement dry-run mode

4. **Test Implementation Tasks**
   - Write integration test for fresh installation
   - Write integration test for update scenario
   - Write integration test for uninstallation
   - Write integration test for dry-run mode
   - Write integration test for graceful degradation

5. **Documentation Tasks**
   - Create quickstart.md with usage examples
   - Update README.md with installation instructions
   - Create troubleshooting guide
   - Document CLI flags and options

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Logger first (dependency for all modules)
- Core modules before CLI (bottom-up approach)
- Tests interleaved with implementation (TDD)
- Documentation after implementation is stable

**Parallelization Opportunities** (marked with [P]):
- Module implementations can be parallelized after logger is complete
- Integration tests can be written in parallel
- Documentation tasks can be parallelized

**Estimated Output**: 40-50 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /buddy:tasks command, NOT by /buddy:plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

*These phases are beyond the scope of the /buddy:plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/buddy:tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following foundational principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation
- Run all integration tests
- Test installation on all supported platforms (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- Execute quickstart.md to verify documentation accuracy
- Validate performance goals (installation time < 30s fresh, < 10s update)
- Test in CI/CD pipeline (non-interactive mode)
