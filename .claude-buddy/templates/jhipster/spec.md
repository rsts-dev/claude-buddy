**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`
**Created**: [DATE]
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: user roles, UI interactions, backend operations, data entities, business rules
3. Determine feature scope (full-stack, frontend-only, backend-only, entity-focused)
   ‚Üí If unclear: Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: scope]
4. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
5. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
6. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
7. Identify Key Entities and Relationships (JHipster JDL perspective)
8. Identify Frontend Requirements (components, pages, navigation)
9. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
10. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY (both frontend and backend)
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no Spring controllers, Angular components, database schemas)
- üë• Written for product stakeholders and full-stack developers
- üéØ JHipster perspective: Think entities, relationships, user interactions, APIs

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "user management" without role details), mark it
3. **Think full-stack**: Every feature likely touches frontend, backend, and database
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - Entity relationships and cardinality
   - User authentication/authorization requirements
   - UI/UX interaction patterns
   - Validation rules (frontend and backend)
   - Data pagination and filtering needs
   - Internationalization requirements
   - Notification mechanisms
   - Integration with external systems

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
[Describe the main user journey from frontend to backend]

**Example**:
As a [user role], I want to [action on UI] so that [business outcome involving data/backend]

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** [user state and UI state], **When** [user interaction on frontend], **Then** [expected UI response and backend effect]
2. **Given** [initial data state], **When** [backend operation triggered by UI], **Then** [expected data change and UI update]

**Example**:
- **Given** authenticated admin user on customer list page, **When** clicking "Create Customer" button and submitting form, **Then** new customer appears in list and is persisted in database
- **Given** invalid email format in form, **When** attempting to submit, **Then** validation error shown on frontend before backend call

### Edge Cases
- What happens when [boundary condition, e.g., empty list, max pagination limit]?
- How does UI handle [error scenario, e.g., backend unavailable, validation failure]?
- What occurs when [concurrent scenario, e.g., two users editing same entity]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**Entity & Data Requirements**:
- **FR-001**: System MUST manage [entity name] with [key attributes]
- **FR-002**: [Entity A] MUST have [relationship type] relationship with [Entity B]
- **FR-003**: System MUST enforce [data validation rule, e.g., "email must be unique"]
- **FR-004**: System MUST support [data operation, e.g., "soft delete", "audit trail"]

**Backend API Requirements**:
- **FR-005**: Backend MUST provide API to [operation, e.g., "create customer"]
- **FR-006**: Backend MUST validate [business rule, e.g., "order total matches line items"]
- **FR-007**: Backend MUST [integration requirement, e.g., "send email notification on order creation"]

**Frontend UI Requirements**:
- **FR-008**: UI MUST display [data view, e.g., "paginated list of customers with search"]
- **FR-009**: UI MUST provide [interaction, e.g., "form to create/edit customer"]
- **FR-010**: UI MUST show [feedback, e.g., "success notification after save"]
- **FR-011**: UI MUST support [navigation, e.g., "breadcrumbs for nested views"]

**Authentication & Authorization Requirements** *(include if feature has security)*:
- **FR-012**: Feature MUST be accessible only to [user roles, e.g., "ADMIN, MANAGER"]
- **FR-013**: Users MUST [auth requirement, e.g., "be authenticated to access feature"]
- **FR-014**: UI MUST [authorization display, e.g., "hide admin actions from regular users"]

**Integration Requirements** *(include if feature integrates externally)*:
- **FR-015**: System MUST integrate with [external service, e.g., "payment gateway"]
- **FR-016**: System MUST [external data requirement, e.g., "fetch currency rates from API"]

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **FR-017**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - JWT, OAuth2, session-based?]
- **FR-018**: Customer entity MUST have relationship with Order entity [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: one-to-many or many-to-many?]
- **FR-019**: UI MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: responsive design for mobile? specific breakpoints?]

### Key Entities & Relationships *(mandatory if feature involves data)*

**Entities** (from JDL perspective, without implementation details):
- **[Entity 1]**: [Brief description, key attributes without types]
  - Example: **Customer**: Represents system users who place orders (name, email, phone, address, status)
- **[Entity 2]**: [Brief description, key attributes]
  - Example: **Order**: Customer purchase transaction (order date, total amount, status, line items)

**Relationships**:
- **[Entity A]** [relationship type] **[Entity B]**
  - Example: **Customer** one-to-many **Order** (one customer can have multiple orders)
  - Example: **Order** many-to-many **Product** (orders contain multiple products, products appear in multiple orders)

**Business Rules**:
- [Validation or constraint rule]
  - Example: Email must be unique across all customers
  - Example: Order total must equal sum of line item totals

## Frontend Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Pages/Views
List the main UI pages or views this feature requires:
- **[Page Name]**: [Purpose and key elements]
  - Example: **Customer List Page**: Displays paginated table of customers with search, filter, and create button

### Components/Interactions
Key UI components and user interactions:
- **[Component/Interaction]**: [Description]
  - Example: **Customer Form**: Create/edit form with validation (name, email, phone, address fields)
  - Example: **Search & Filter**: Text search across name/email, dropdown filter by status
  - Example: **Confirmation Dialog**: "Are you sure?" prompt before delete operations

### Navigation
How users navigate through the feature:

  - Example: Dashboard ‚Üí Customer List ‚Üí Customer Detail ‚Üí Edit Customer ‚Üí Save ‚Üí Customer Detail
  - Example: Order List ‚Üí Create Order ‚Üí Select Customer ‚Üí Add Products ‚Üí Submit ‚Üí Order Confirmation

### UI Validation
Frontend validation rules (separate from backend validation):
- [Validation rule]
  - Example: Email field must match email pattern before form submission
  - Example: Required fields must be filled before enabling submit button
  - Example: Date fields must be valid dates and not in the past
