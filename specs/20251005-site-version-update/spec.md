## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A developer or potential user visits the Claude Buddy website to learn about the framework and understand what has changed in version 2. They expect to see clear information about new features, benefits over the previous version, simplified installation process, and compelling reasons to adopt version 2.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new visitor arrives at the site, **When** they view the hero section, **Then** they immediately understand Claude Buddy v2 is a major upgrade with NPM-based installation
2. **Given** a user of Claude Buddy v1 visits the site, **When** they look for version 2 changes, **Then** they find clear migration benefits and new feature highlights
3. **Given** a developer wants to install Claude Buddy, **When** they view the installation section, **Then** they see the simplified NPM installation process prominently featured
4. **Given** a visitor wants to understand v2 benefits, **When** they browse the features section, **Then** they see clear comparisons between v1 and v2 capabilities
5. **Given** a user wants to explore advanced features, **When** they navigate the site, **Then** they find information about the new setup CLI, automated workflows, and foundation-driven development

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a visitor is unfamiliar with Claude Code?
- How does system handle users who want to upgrade from v1 to v2?
- What if a user wants to understand the technical architecture changes?
- How does the site address concerns about breaking changes?

### Clarifications Received

All clarification questions have been addressed with the following answers:

1. **GitHub Repository Strategy**: Update all repository links to the new URL: `https://github.com/rsts-dev/claude-buddy`

2. **Migration Support**: No dedicated migration guide needed at this point since Claude Buddy v1 was not widely adopted.

3. **Performance Metrics**: No specific performance metrics to highlight at this time; focus on feature improvements instead.

4. **Version History**: Include a high-level changelog/timeline highlighting the evolution to keep up with Claude Code new features and the adoption of specification-driven development workflow ideas.

5. **Business Model**: v2 remains free and open-source, same as v1.

6. **Social Proof**: No testimonials or case studies available yet for v2.

7. **Interactive Features**: No interactive demos or playground features at this time.

8. **Support Commitment**: Plan is to continue enhancing v2 while supporting an upgrade path via the installation script.

9. **Breaking Changes**: No breaking changes from v1 to v2, as the core personas feature is preserved in v2.

10. **Documentation Structure**: Replace v1 documentation entirely with v2 documentation (no parallel documentation versions).

### Assumptions Made

Based on the analysis of the existing site and v2 implementation, the following assumptions have been made:

1. The primary brand identity (infinity symbol, color scheme) remains unchanged
2. The existing site structure and navigation should be preserved
3. SEO optimizations from the previous version should be maintained
4. The site should continue to target the same audience (developers using Claude Code)
5. Performance optimization goals from TODO.md should still be pursued
6. The responsive design and accessibility features should be enhanced, not replaced
7. The GitHub repository structure remains under the same organization
8. The free and open-source nature of the project continues in v2
