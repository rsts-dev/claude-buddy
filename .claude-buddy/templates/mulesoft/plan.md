# MuleSoft API Implementation Plan: [API NAME]

**Branch**: `[###-api-name]`
**Spec**: [link]
**Created**: [DATE]
**Status**: Draft
**API Layer**: [System/Process/Experience] | **Deployment**: [CloudHub/RTF/Hybrid]
**Input**: API specification from `/specs/[###-api-name]/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load API spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No API spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect API Layer (System/Process/Experience)
   → Determine deployment target and runtime version
   → Identify required connectors and policies
3. Fill the Foundation Check section based on the content of the foundation document
4. Evaluate Foundation Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Foundation Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → api-specification.raml (or .yaml for OAS), dataweave/, error-handlers.xml, munit/, policies.json, agent-specific template file
7. Re-evaluate Foundation Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Foundation Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 8. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Foundation Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Based on `/.claude-buddy/foundation.md` v1.0.0, verify compliance with:

### Principle 1: Template-Driven Architecture
- [ ] This plan follows the template structure with explicit phases
- [ ] All file paths are absolute (not relative)
- [ ] Execution flow is numbered and sequential

### Principle 2: Agent Specialization
- [ ] Agent updates follow incremental pattern (O(1) operation)
- [ ] No cross-domain responsibilities mixed in this API

### Principle 3: Phase-Gated Execution
- [ ] Each phase has clear validation gates
- [ ] Prerequisites are explicitly checked before progression
- [ ] Outputs are documented for downstream phases

### Principle 4: Test-First Development
- [ ] MUnit tests will be created before flow implementation
- [ ] Contract tests (API spec validation) precede endpoint implementation
- [ ] Integration tests precede API completion

### Principle 5: Explicit Error Handling
- [ ] Research phase addresses error scenarios
- [ ] API spec includes error response definitions
- [ ] Implementation will include global error handlers

### Principle 6: Semantic Versioning
- [ ] API branch follows naming convention
- [ ] API spec will be versioned (v1, v2, etc.)
- [ ] Changes will be documented in commit messages

### MuleSoft API-Led Principles
- [ ] API layer assignment is appropriate (System/Process/Experience)
- [ ] API is designed for reusability across consumers
- [ ] No business logic in System APIs (data access only)
- [ ] Process APIs orchestrate, not replicate System API logic
- [ ] Experience APIs don't contain business logic
- [ ] Security policies align with layer responsibilities

**Violations Requiring Justification**: [List any principle violations and provide rationale in Complexity Tracking section]

```

**Structure Decision**: [Document the chosen MuleSoft project structure, API layer assignment, and module organization rationale]

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each connector → version compatibility and best practices
   - For each security policy → configuration requirements
   - For each integration → API-Led layer boundaries

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {API context}"
   For each MuleSoft connector:
     Task: "Find best practices and limitations for {connector} {version}"
   For each API-Led layer decision:
     Task: "Validate layer assignment against reusability requirements"
   For each security requirement:
     Task: "Research policy configuration for {requirement}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen - include API-Led principles]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]
   - Connector/Policy Configuration: [specific settings]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Create API specification** from requirements → `api-specification.raml` (or OAS):
   - Define resources and methods per REST best practices
   - Specify request/response schemas (JSON/XML)
   - Document error responses (standard error format)
   - Include examples for all operations
   - Define data types in RAML library or OAS components
   - Version API appropriately (v1, v2, etc.)

2. **Design DataWeave transformations** from API contracts:
   - Input/output mapping specifications
   - Lookup/enrichment requirements
   - Validation logic
   - Standard format transformations (JSON↔XML, CSV, etc.)
   - Output to `dataweave/mappings.md`

3. **Design error handling strategy**:
   - Global error handler configuration
   - Layer-specific error transformations
   - Error response formats per API spec
   - Logging and monitoring requirements
   - Output to `error-handlers.md`

4. **Define security policies** from requirements:
   - Policy types (OAuth 2.0, Client ID, Rate Limiting, etc.)
   - Policy configuration parameters
   - SLA tiers if applicable
   - Custom policy requirements
   - Output to `policies.json`

5. **Generate MUnit test scenarios** from API spec:
   - Contract tests: Validate API spec compliance
   - Positive scenarios: Happy path per operation
   - Negative scenarios: Error handling validation
   - Connector mocking strategies
   - Coverage requirements (>80% line coverage)
   - Tests must fail initially (no implementation yet)
   - Output to `munit/test-plan.md`

6. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `{SCRIPT}`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Add MuleSoft connectors and their versions
   - Add DataWeave patterns identified
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: api-specification.raml, dataweave/mappings.md, error-handlers.md, policies.json, munit/test-plan.md, failing MUnit tests, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs
- Each API operation → contract MUnit test task [P]
- Each DataWeave mapping → transformation script task [P]
- Each error scenario → error handler task [P]
- Each security policy → policy configuration task
- Implementation tasks to make MUnit tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: MUnit tests before flow implementation
- Dependency order:
  1. Global configs and error handlers
  2. API interface flows
  3. DataWeave transformations
  4. Implementation flows
  5. Connector configurations
  6. Policy deployment
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent flows/tests)

**Estimated Output**: 20-35 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following foundational principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation
  - Run MUnit tests (>80% coverage)
  - API Manager policy enforcement tests
  - Performance testing (load/stress tests)
  - Deploy to test environment
  - Integration testing with consumers

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Foundation Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|--------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th layer API] | [specific need] | [why 3 layers insufficient] |
| [e.g., Custom connector] | [integration requirement] | [why standard connector insufficient] |
| [e.g., Synchronous process] | [latency requirement] | [why async pattern not viable] |
