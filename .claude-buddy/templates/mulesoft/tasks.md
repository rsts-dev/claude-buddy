# Tasks: [API NAME]

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/[###-api-name]/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, api-specification.raml, dataweave/mappings.md, munit/test-plan.md

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from API directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: Mule runtime version, connectors, DataWeave patterns, deployment target
2. Load required design documents:
   → api-specification.raml: Extract resources/operations → MUnit contract tests
   → dataweave/mappings.md: Extract transformations → DataWeave script tasks
   → munit/test-plan.md: Extract scenarios → MUnit test tasks
   → error-handlers.md: Extract error flows → error handler tasks
   → policies.json: Extract policies → API Manager tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Project init, RAML/OAS, global configs, properties
   → Tests: MUnit contract tests, integration tests (MUST come first)
   → Core: API interface flows, DataWeave transformations
   → Implementation: Business logic flows, connector configurations
   → Integration: Error handlers, logging, monitoring
   → Polish: Unit tests, performance tests, documentation, policies
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different flows/files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same flow = sequential (no [P])
   → MUnit tests before flow implementation (TDD)
   → Interface flows before implementation flows
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All API operations have MUnit contract tests?
   → All transformations have DataWeave scripts?
   → All flows have corresponding tests?
   → Error handlers cover all scenarios?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Dependencies

**Critical Path**:
- Setup (T001-T006) → Tests (T007-T013) → Implementation (T014-T024)
- Tests MUST fail before implementation begins
- Interface flows (T014-T017) before implementation flows (T021-T024)
- DataWeave scripts (T018-T020) before flows that use them
- Global config (T004) before connector config (T025)
- Error handlers (T029-T032) before polish phase
- Implementation complete before API Manager policies (T048-T053)

**Blocking Dependencies**:
- T003 (API spec) blocks T007-T010 (contract tests)
- T004 (global config) blocks T025 (connector config)
- T007-T013 (all tests) block T014-T024 (implementation)
- T014-T017 (interface flows) block T021-T024 (implementation flows)
- T018-T020 (DataWeave) required by T014-T024 (flows using transformations)
- T025 (connector config) blocks T026 (connector operations)
- T029-T030 (error handlers) block T031-T032 (error logging)
- T039 (coverage) validates T007-T038 (all tests)
- T048 (Exchange publish) blocks T049-T053 (API Manager tasks)

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Example 1: Property Files (T005)
```bash
# Launch T005 sub-tasks together:
Task: "Create local.yaml in src/main/resources/properties/"
Task: "Create dev.yaml in src/main/resources/properties/"
Task: "Create prod.yaml in src/main/resources/properties/"
```

### Example 2: Contract Tests (T007-T010)
```bash
# Launch T007-T010 together:
Task: "MUnit contract test GET /customers in src/test/munit/contract/get-customers-test.xml"
Task: "MUnit contract test POST /customers in src/test/munit/contract/post-customers-test.xml"
Task: "MUnit contract test PUT /customers/{id} in src/test/munit/contract/put-customer-test.xml"
Task: "MUnit contract test DELETE /customers/{id} in src/test/munit/contract/delete-customer-test.xml"
```

### Example 3: DataWeave Transformations (T018-T020)
```bash
# Launch T018-T020 together:
Task: "DataWeave request mapping in src/main/resources/dataweave/transformations/request-to-salesforce.dwl"
Task: "DataWeave response mapping in src/main/resources/dataweave/transformations/salesforce-to-response.dwl"
Task: "DataWeave error mapping in src/main/resources/dataweave/transformations/error-to-standard-format.dwl"
```

## Notes
- **[P] tasks** = different files/flows, no dependencies
- **Verify MUnit tests fail** before implementing flows (TDD validation)
- **Commit after each task** with meaningful messages
- **Run MUnit tests** after each implementation task
- **Use MUnit test recorder** to accelerate test creation
- **Mock external systems** in MUnit tests (use Spy, Mock processors)
- **Follow DataWeave best practices** (avoid side effects, use functions)
- **Externalize all configuration** (no hardcoded values in flows)
- **Use flow-ref** for reusability across operations
- **Avoid**: Vague tasks, same file conflicts, missing error handling

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From API Specification**:
   - Each resource + method → contract MUnit test task [P]
   - Each operation → interface flow task [P]
   - Each operation → implementation flow task

2. **From DataWeave Mappings**:
   - Each transformation → DataWeave script task [P]
   - Each transformation → unit test task [P]

3. **From MUnit Test Plan**:
   - Each test scenario → MUnit test task [P]
   - Each error scenario → error handler task

4. **From Connectors**:
   - Each connector → configuration task
   - Each connector operation → flow task
   - Each connector → mock task [P]

5. **From Policies**:
   - Each policy → API Manager configuration task
   - Related policies can be applied in parallel [P]

6. **Ordering**:
   - Setup → MUnit Tests → Interface Flows → DataWeave → Implementation → Error Handlers → Polish → Policies
   - Dependencies block parallel execution
   - Always MUnit tests before corresponding flow implementation

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked by main() before returning*

- [ ] All API operations have corresponding MUnit contract tests
- [ ] All DataWeave transformations have unit tests
- [ ] All flows have corresponding MUnit integration tests
- [ ] All tests come before their implementation
- [ ] Parallel tasks are truly independent (different files/flows)
- [ ] Each task specifies exact file path
- [ ] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [ ] Global config created before connector configs
- [ ] Error handlers created before polish phase
- [ ] API Manager tasks after implementation is complete
- [ ] MUnit coverage task is last in test sequence
