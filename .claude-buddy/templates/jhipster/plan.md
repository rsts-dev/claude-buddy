# JHipster Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`
**Spec**: [link]
**Created**: [DATE]
**Status**: Draft
**Application Type**: [Monolith/Microservices/Gateway] | **Stack**: [Reactive/Imperative]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/buddy:plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Application Type (monolith, microservices, gateway)
   → Determine stack choices (frontend framework, database, authentication)
   → Identify JHipster generator options
3. Fill the Foundation Check section based on the content of the foundation document
4. Evaluate Foundation Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Foundation Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → jdl-model.jdl, api-contracts/, frontend-design.md, test-scenarios.md, agent-specific template file
7. Re-evaluate Foundation Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Foundation Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /buddy:tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /buddy:plan command STOPS at step 8. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /buddy:tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Foundation Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Based on `/directive/foundation.md` v1.0.0, verify compliance with:

### Principle 1: Modular Extensibility
- [ ] Feature components are designed as independent modules
- [ ] New functionality extends without modifying core framework
- [ ] Templates and configurations are properly isolated

### Principle 2: Safety-First Automation
- [ ] All automated operations include validation steps
- [ ] Destructive operations are explicitly protected
- [ ] Error handling prevents unintended consequences

### Principle 3: Contextual Intelligence
- [ ] Design leverages foundation document principles
- [ ] Context from previous phases propagates forward
- [ ] Templates maintain consistency with project patterns

### Principle 4: Developer Experience Excellence
- [ ] Clear documentation for all new components
- [ ] Error messages provide actionable guidance
- [ ] Progressive disclosure of advanced features

### Principle 5: Transparent Collaboration
- [ ] Changes maintain clear attribution trails
- [ ] Automated operations are logged appropriately
- [ ] Human review points are explicitly defined

**Violations Requiring Justification**: [List any principle violations and provide rationale in Complexity Tracking section]

**Structure Decision**: [Document the selected structure and reference the real
directories captured above. Specify monolith vs microservices rationale.]

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each technology choice → best practices task
   - For each JHipster option → configuration research

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each JHipster generator option:
     Task: "Find best practices for {option} in JHipster {version}"
   For each entity relationship:
     Task: "Research JDL patterns for {relationship type}"
   For each integration requirement:
     Task: "Research JHipster integration patterns for {external system}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]
   - JHipster Configuration: [generator options, JDL modeling decisions]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Create JDL model** from feature spec → `jdl-model.jdl`:
   - Define entities with fields and field types
   - Specify relationships (OneToMany, ManyToOne, ManyToMany, OneToOne)
   - Add validation rules (@required, @min, @max, @pattern, etc.)
   - Configure pagination, filtering, service layer
   - Include entity options (dto, service, pagination)
   - Example:
     ```
     entity Customer {
       name String required maxlength(100)
       email String required pattern(/^[^@\s]+@[^@\s]+\.[^@\s]+$/)
       phone String
     }

     entity Order {
       orderDate Instant required
       totalAmount BigDecimal required min(0)
       status OrderStatus required
     }

     enum OrderStatus {
       PENDING, CONFIRMED, SHIPPED, DELIVERED, CANCELLED
     }

     relationship OneToMany {
       Customer{orders} to Order{customer required}
     }

     paginate Customer, Order with pagination
     service Customer, Order with serviceClass
     dto Customer, Order with mapstruct
     ```

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each REST endpoint → OpenAPI specification
   - Document request/response schemas
   - Include error response formats
   - Output to `/api-contracts/[entity]-api.yaml`

3. **Design frontend components** from UI requirements:
   - List pages (entity list views with search/filter/pagination)
   - Detail pages (entity detail with CRUD operations)
   - Forms (create/edit with validation)
   - Custom components (if beyond generated CRUD)
   - Navigation flow
   - Output to `frontend-design.md`

4. **Generate test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Backend tests:
     - Repository tests (JPA operations)
     - Service tests (business logic)
     - REST controller tests (integration tests with MockMvc/WebTestClient)
   - Frontend tests:
     - Component tests (Jest/Jasmine)
     - End-to-end tests (Cypress/Playwright)
   - Each user story → test scenario
   - Output to `test-scenarios.md`

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `{SCRIPT}`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: jdl-model.jdl, /api-contracts/*, frontend-design.md, test-scenarios.md (with failing tests), agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /buddy:tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /buddy:plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs
- JDL model → entity generation tasks
- Each entity → backend tests (repository, service, REST)
- Each entity → frontend tests (component, e2e)
- Custom business logic → service implementation tasks
- Custom UI components → frontend component tasks

**Ordering Strategy**:
- JHipster setup → JDL entity generation → Backend tests → Backend implementation → Frontend tests → Frontend implementation
- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Entities before services before controllers before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent entities/components)

**Estimated Output**: 30-40 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /buddy:tasks command, NOT by /buddy:plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /buddy:plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/buddy:tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following foundational principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation
  - Run backend tests (JUnit, Spring tests)
  - Run frontend tests (Jest/Karma, Cypress/Playwright)
  - Manual testing against test scenarios
  - Performance validation (<200ms API response)
  - Security validation (authentication/authorization)
  - Build and package application

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Foundation Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., Custom authentication] | [specific need] | [why JWT/OAuth insufficient] |
| [e.g., Additional microservice] | [scalability requirement] | [why monolith insufficient] |
