# API Specification: [API NAME]

**API Branch**: `[###-api-name]`
**Created**: [DATE]
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No API description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: consumers, operations, data flows, constraints
3. Determine API Layer (System/Process/Experience)
   ‚Üí If unclear: Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: layer assignment rationale]
4. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
5. Fill Consumer Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear consumer flow: ERROR "Cannot determine consumer scenarios"
6. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
7. Identify API Contract Elements (resources, operations, data models)
8. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
9. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT the API provides and WHY consumers need it
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no connectors, DataWeave, flows, XML)
- üë• Written for API consumers and business stakeholders, not MuleSoft developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every API
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the API
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "customer API" without operations), mark it
3. **Think like an API consumer**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - API layer assignment rationale
   - Consumer authentication methods
   - Data transformation scope
   - Rate limiting and SLA requirements
   - Error response formats
   - Pagination requirements
   - Versioning strategy
   - Backward compatibility needs

## API Layer Classification *(mandatory)*

**Assigned Layer**: [System API / Process API / Experience API]

**Rationale**: [Explain why this API belongs in this layer]
- System API: Direct integration with a backend system/database, providing data access with no business logic
- Process API: Orchestrates multiple System APIs, applies business logic, composes data
- Experience API: Tailored for specific consumer channels (mobile, web, partner), optimized for consumption

**Reusability Scope**: [Who will consume this API? Single channel or multiple consumers?]

---

## Consumer Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary Consumer Use Cases
[Describe how API consumers will use this API]

**Example**:
- Mobile app needs to retrieve customer profile with order history
- Partner portal needs to submit orders and check status
- Internal dashboard needs to display real-time metrics

### API Operation Flows
1. **Given** [consumer state], **When** [API call with parameters], **Then** [expected response]
2. **Given** [consumer state], **When** [API call with parameters], **Then** [expected response]

**Example**:
- **Given** authenticated user, **When** GET /customers/{id}, **Then** return customer profile with 200 status
- **Given** invalid customer ID, **When** GET /customers/{id}, **Then** return error response with 404 status

### Edge Cases
- What happens when [boundary condition, e.g., pagination limit exceeded]?
- How does API handle [error scenario, e.g., downstream system unavailable]?
- What occurs when [data scenario, e.g., customer has no orders]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**API Operations**:
- **FR-001**: API MUST provide [operation, e.g., "retrieve customer by ID"]
- **FR-002**: API MUST support [operation, e.g., "create new customer"]
- **FR-003**: API MUST allow [operation, e.g., "update customer status"]
- **FR-004**: API MUST enable [operation, e.g., "search customers by criteria"]

**Data Requirements**:
- **FR-005**: API MUST return [data elements, e.g., "customer name, email, phone, address"]
- **FR-006**: API MUST accept [input data, e.g., "customer registration data"]
- **FR-007**: API MUST validate [data rules, e.g., "email format, phone number format"]
- **FR-008**: API MUST transform [data mapping, e.g., "internal codes to display labels"]

**Behavior Requirements**:
- **FR-009**: API MUST [behavior, e.g., "respond within 500ms for 95% of requests"]
- **FR-010**: API MUST [constraint, e.g., "support pagination with max 100 records per page"]
- **FR-011**: API MUST [error handling, e.g., "return standard error format for all failures"]

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **FR-012**: API MUST authenticate consumers via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - API key, OAuth 2.0, Basic Auth?]
- **FR-013**: API MUST integrate with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: backend system not specified - Salesforce, SAP, database?]
- **FR-014**: API MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: data format not specified - JSON, XML, both?]

### Security & Policy Requirements *(include if API has security needs)*
- **Authentication**: [How consumers authenticate, e.g., OAuth 2.0, API key]
- **Authorization**: [What permissions consumers need, e.g., read-only, full access]
- **Rate Limiting**: [Request limits per consumer, e.g., 1000 requests/hour]
- **Data Privacy**: [PII handling, masking requirements]
- **Compliance**: [Industry standards, e.g., HIPAA, PCI-DSS]

### Performance & Scale Requirements *(include if API has performance needs)*
- **Latency**: [Response time targets, e.g., p95 < 500ms]
- **Throughput**: [Request volume, e.g., 1000 TPS]
- **Availability**: [Uptime requirements, e.g., 99.9%]
- **Payload Size**: [Max request/response size]
- **Concurrent Consumers**: [Expected load]

### API Contract Elements *(mandatory)*

**Resources**: [RESTful resources the API exposes]
- `/customers` - Customer collection
- `/customers/{id}` - Individual customer
- `/orders` - Order collection
- `/orders/{id}` - Individual order

**Operations**: [HTTP methods and their purpose]
- GET /customers - Retrieve customer list
- POST /customers - Create new customer
- GET /customers/{id} - Retrieve customer by ID
- PUT /customers/{id} - Update customer
- DELETE /customers/{id} - Delete customer

**Request Data Models**: [Key input data structures without implementation]
- **Customer**: [name, email, phone, address, preferences]
- **Order**: [customer ID, items, total, shipping address]

**Response Data Models**: [Key output data structures]
- **Customer**: [id, name, email, status, created date, order count]
- **Order**: [id, customer info, items, status, tracking]

**Error Responses**: [Standard error format]
- Error code, message, timestamp, correlation ID

### Integration Requirements *(include if API integrates with external systems)*
- **Upstream Systems**: [Systems this API calls, e.g., Salesforce CRM, MySQL database]
- **Downstream Consumers**: [Who will call this API, e.g., mobile app, web portal]
- **Data Sources**: [Where data originates]
- **Data Synchronization**: [Real-time vs batch, caching requirements]
