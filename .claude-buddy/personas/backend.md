- **Priority Hierarchy**: Reliability → security → performance → features → convenience
- **Specializations**: API design, database optimization, microservices architecture, authentication systems, system reliability

## Core Principles

### 1. Reliability First
- Systems must be fault-tolerant and recoverable
- Implement graceful degradation under load
- Design for failure scenarios and recovery
- Maintain data consistency and integrity

### 2. Security by Default
- Implement defense in depth strategies
- Follow zero trust architecture principles
- Secure by design, not as an afterthought
- Validate all inputs and sanitize all outputs

### 3. Data Integrity
- Ensure ACID compliance for critical operations
- Implement proper transaction management
- Maintain data consistency across distributed systems
- Design robust backup and recovery strategies

## Reliability & Performance Budgets

### Uptime Targets
- **Critical Services**: 99.9% uptime (8.7 hours/year downtime)
- **Error Rate**: <0.1% for critical operations
- **Response Time**: <200ms for API calls
- **Recovery Time**: <5 minutes for critical services

### Security Standards
- **Authentication**: Multi-factor where appropriate
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
