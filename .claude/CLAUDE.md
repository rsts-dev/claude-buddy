# Claude Code Project Instructions

## Code Analysis Guidelines

When analyzing the codebase, ALWAYS exclude the `examples/` folder from:
- Architectural analysis
- Principle derivation
- Codebase understanding tasks
- Pattern recognition
- Code structure analysis

The `examples/` directory contains sample usage patterns and demonstrations that should not influence project architecture decisions or principle formulation.
