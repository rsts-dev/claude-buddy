## Quick Guidelines
- Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a developer or team adopting Claude Buddy, I need a simple, reliable installation process that sets up all necessary components (hooks, personas, templates, configurations) with minimal manual intervention. The installation should detect my environment, handle both fresh installations and updates intelligently, support preview mode for safety, and provide clear verification that everything is working correctly.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Fresh Installation
1. **Given** a project directory without Claude Buddy installed, **When** user runs the installation script, **Then** the system creates all necessary directories, installs hooks, copies templates, configures personas, and displays a success message with version information and usage examples.

#### Scenario 2: Update Existing Installation
1. **Given** a project with Claude Buddy v1.0.0 installed, **When** user runs the installation script for v1.1.0, **Then** the system detects the existing installation, preserves user customizations, updates only framework files, migrates configuration if needed, and displays what was updated.

#### Scenario 3: Dry-Run Mode
1. **Given** any installation state, **When** user runs the script with dry-run flag, **Then** the system analyzes the environment, shows what actions would be performed, reports any issues or warnings, but does not modify any files or configurations.

#### Scenario 4: Graceful Degradation for Missing Requirements
1. **Given** an environment where UV (Python package manager) is not installed, **When** user runs the installation script, **Then** the system detects UV is missing, skips hook installation with a clear warning message, continues installing other components (templates, personas, configs), and completes successfully with partial functionality documented.

#### Scenario 5: Uninstallation
1. **Given** a project with Claude Buddy installed, **When** user runs the uninstallation command, **Then** the system removes all Claude Buddy files, cleans up hooks, optionally preserves user customizations based on prompt, and displays confirmation of removed components.

#### Scenario 6: Post-Installation Verification
1. **Given** a completed installation, **When** the installation script finishes, **Then** the system verifies all components are accessible, displays the installed version, shows available slash commands, provides usage examples, and confirms hook registration status.

### Edge Cases

#### Missing Permissions
- What happens when the script lacks write permissions to target directories?
  - System MUST detect permission issues before attempting installation
  - System MUST display clear error message indicating required permissions
  - System MUST suggest resolution steps (e.g., "Run with appropriate permissions" or "Check directory ownership")

#### Corrupted Existing Installation
- How does the system handle a partially corrupted Claude Buddy installation?
  - System MUST detect inconsistent state during pre-installation checks
  - System MUST offer repair option or clean reinstall
  - System MUST back up existing configuration before proceeding

#### Network Failures During Installation
- What happens when dependency downloads fail mid-installation?
  - System MUST implement transactional installation (rollback on failure)
  - System MUST provide clear error messages with retry instructions
  - System MUST not leave system in broken state

#### Conflicting Configurations
- How does the system handle conflicts between existing configurations and new defaults?
  - System MUST detect configuration conflicts before overwriting
  - System MUST prompt user for conflict resolution strategy (keep existing, use new, merge)
  - System MUST preserve custom user configurations by default

#### Platform-Specific Failures
- What happens when platform-specific dependencies are unavailable?
  - System MUST detect platform compatibility during pre-checks
  - System MUST degrade gracefully for optional platform-specific features
  - System MUST clearly document which features are unavailable and why

#### Interrupted Installation
- How does the system recover from interrupted installation (e.g., user cancels)?
  - System MUST track installation progress
  - System MUST support resume or cleanup of partial installation
  - System MUST not leave configuration in unstable state

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Installation Management
- **FR-001**: System MUST support fresh installation mode that creates all necessary directory structures, configuration files, hooks, templates, and persona definitions
- **FR-002**: System MUST support update mode that preserves user customizations while upgrading framework files to newer versions
- **FR-003**: System MUST detect existing Claude Buddy installations and automatically determine whether to perform fresh install or update
- **FR-004**: System MUST implement dry-run mode that previews all actions without modifying any files or configurations
- **FR-005**: System MUST support uninstallation mode that removes all Claude Buddy components with optional preservation of user customizations

#### Environment Detection & Validation
- **FR-006**: System MUST detect the operating system platform (macOS, Linux, Windows) and adapt installation process accordingly
- **FR-007**: System MUST verify write permissions to target directories before beginning installation
- **FR-008**: System MUST check for required dependencies (Node.js, Python, UV) and report their availability status
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate existing installation integrity before performing updates

#### Graceful Degradation
- **FR-010**: System MUST continue installation with reduced functionality when optional dependencies are missing (e.g., skip hooks if UV unavailable)
- **FR-011**: System MUST clearly document which features are unavailable due to missing dependencies

## Clarifications Received

All initial ambiguities have been resolved through user input:

1. **Uninstallation Support**: YES - The installation script must include uninstallation/removal functionality with optional preservation of user customizations.

2. **Update-Specific Logic**: YES - The script must distinguish between fresh installations and updates, implementing appropriate logic for each scenario (preserve customizations on updates, create defaults on fresh installs).

3. **Missing System Requirements**: GRACEFUL DEGRADATION - When optional dependencies are unavailable (e.g., UV not installed), the script should skip related features (hooks) with clear warnings but continue installing other components successfully.

4. **Dry-Run Mode**: YES - The script must support a dry-run/preview mode that shows what actions would be performed without actually modifying any files.

5. **Post-Installation Verification**: YES - The script must include verification steps that confirm successful installation, display version information, show available commands, and provide usage examples to help users get started.

## Assumptions Made

1. **Package Management**: Assumed the installation will be distributed via NPM, aligning with the project's distribution strategy mentioned in the foundation.

2. **Directory Structure**: Assumed Claude Buddy follows the standard directory structure as seen in foundation document:
   - `.claude-buddy/` for framework files
   - `.claude/` for hooks and commands
   - `directive/` for foundation documents

3. **Python Hooks**: Assumed hooks are implemented in Python using the cchooks library as specified in the foundation's Principle 1.

4. **Configuration Preservation**: Assumed user customizations are identified by files modified after initial installation timestamp or marked with custom comments/metadata.

5. **Non-Interactive Default**: Assumed the script should work in non-interactive mode by default to support CI/CD pipelines, with interactive prompts only for conflict resolution when explicitly enabled.

6. **Version Detection**: Assumed version information is stored in a standardized location (e.g., `.claude-buddy/version.json` or similar) for detection during updates.
